#SIMPLE CHATBOT

This project is a simple rule-based chatbot developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python. The chatbot is designed to simulate basic conversations with users by processing their input and providing relevant responses. It uses core NLP techniques such as tokenization, keyword matching, and intent recognition to understand what the user is trying to say. The system can handle greetings, small talk, and simple queries, making it an excellent introductory project for those learning how to build conversational agents. The project is terminal-based, lightweight, and easily extendable by adding more predefined intents and responses. It uses libraries such as NLTK or spaCy and re (regex) for text processing.


#TICTACTOE

This project is a Python-based version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where a human player competes against an unbeatable AI opponent. The AI is powered by the Minimax algorithm, a recursive decision-making process used in two-player turn-based games. The algorithm evaluates all possible moves and selects the one that maximizes its chance of winning while minimizing the opponent's. As a result, the AI never losesâ€”it either wins or forces a draw. The game runs in the terminal, offering a clean interface for move input and board display. This project is an excellent example of implementing game theory and AI decision-making logic in a simple and understandable way.


#FACE DETECTION
This project performs face detection on static images using OpenCV, a widely-used computer vision library in Python. The system uses pre-trained models such as Haar Cascades to identify and locate human faces within a given image. When an image is passed to the program, it processes the file, detects facial regions, and draws bounding boxes around detected faces. This project demonstrates how object detection works with still images and serves as a solid foundation for building more advanced applications like face recognition or face masking. It is ideal for beginners in computer vision who want to understand image analysis and feature detection using simple and efficient techniques.
